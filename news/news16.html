    <h1>Los Angeles Barber Goes Viral After Messages Show He Charges Over $1,000 for Home Haircuts</h1>
    <p>While there's no way to tell if the screenshot is authentic, it's undoubtedly an eye-raising price for a haircut. However, it's not uncommon for the rich and famous to splash out on expensive haircuts, especially if they want it done by someone who knows what they're doing.<br>

        Last year, Bad Boy Records founder Diddy revealed that he never gets a haircut that costs under $1,000. In fact, he sometimes gets five haircuts a day. “Oh yeah, so this just in, it’s $1,000 a cut,” he said, per HipHopDX. "No for real, this my barber, and I share him with the world and he’s one of the best, but it’s like I’m outside, outside, so it’s like I need my hair like done every five minutes. ... My daily price is $5,000, and I’m just telling y’all the truth. This my barber Marcus, I love you brother. Don’t take nothing less than $1,000 from me. Know your worth king."

        Diddy isn't the only rapper dropping lots of cash on getting his hair done. In recent years, Drake has started sporting a variety of braided hairstyles. He even has a go-to hair braider, Bri Marie, who spoke with Complex about how she landed the lucrative gig last year.<br>

        Earlier this year, former NBA player Jalen Rose said he thinks that men should spend a minimum of $100 on their haircuts, per the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.<br>

        Dallas Cowboys linebacker Micah Parsons tweeted last year that he was shocked to find out his barber had raised his house call price. "My barber upped his house call price to 200!!!" he tweeted. "I might grow an afro now!" He later clarified that he meant "no disrespect to barbers" with the comment and admitted he doesn't value his appearance enough to spend $200 on a haircut. "If I was a model hell yeah my appearance matter but I am a football player!! I wear a helmet the whole game!" he added. "No one is at home wondering how I look under my helmet!!"
