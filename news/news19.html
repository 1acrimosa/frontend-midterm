    <h1>Failure to launch – the satellite industry problem and also something</h1>
    <p>Yes, it's a cliché, but with meaning: "If we can go to the moon, why can't we…?" Fill in the blank with your favorite want-to-have.

        While landing humans on the moon was indeed historic and the boot-kicked lunar dust has settled, perhaps that achievement had more of an impact on society than we realized. The 20th century reverberations from the Apollo program in the  continue to waft through our 21st century society — in a way that heralds striving for the once thought unattainable.<br>

        So use of the term "moonshot" is everywhere. Seemingly it's a word anchored in an earlier turn of phrase, "shoot for the moon." Collectively, these Apollo-esque idioms imply aspiring for a lofty goal. For instance, underway at Stanford University there is a "moonshot effort" that aims to 3D print a human heart.<br>

        Then there's the Moonshot Museum in Pennsylvania, operated by the Astrobotic Foundation. Its focus is exclusively on career-plus-community readiness for the 21st century space industry. From the quest for cancer cures to new strides in artificial intelligence, these are innovative ways to make something unexpected happen. Ten years in, the Google X "moonshot factory" has incubated hundreds of different ideas, be it driverless cars, robots for manufacturing purposes, even life extension. They define moonshot as a task or idea that addresses a huge problem, proposes a radical solution, and makes use of breakthrough technology.

        According to Google X, anyone in any field can take a moonshot. "Not all moonshots have to include a science or technology breakthrough; that's just what we know best at X. Each of our moonshots sits at the intersection of these three ingredients: a huge problem in the world that affects millions or billions of people; a radical, sci-fi sounding solution that may seem impossible today; a technology breakthrough that gives us a glimmer of hope that the solution could be possible in the next 5-10 years."

        Others, like the National Cancer Institute at the National Institutes of Health are engaged in the "Cancer Moonshot" to accelerate cancer study and make more therapies available to more patients, while also advancing the capacity to prevent cancer and detect it at an early stage.<br>

        "With our understanding of human biology and cancer biology, and our ability to harness new modalities of medicine, and the reality that machine learning and AI are going to make for better medicines more quickly, we're at a critical moment where the Cancer Moonshot goal can be realized if we come together," said David Epstein, CEO of Seagen a global biotechnology company, during a discussion on cancer recently held by POLITICO.
